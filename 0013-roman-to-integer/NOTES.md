# approach #1  - declare special cases then check
average speed and space

# approach #2 - translate speical cases into normal cases
even with more iterations replaces are faster, i guess 

# approach #3 - 
compares two letters - if latter value is bigger, subtract. 
need dictionary for value comparison

# code toolbox
- s.replace
- range(start, stop, step) - confusing bc for python, its comma. in other langs ; 
- python Ternary Operator : [true_value] if [condition] else [false_value]
